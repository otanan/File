# File

A simple file reader program in C. Effectively wraps the current C file input functions into a more intuitive form. Inspired by Java's methods for IO.


## Getting Started

Files are opened using standard C libaries. Passing in a function pointer into these functions allows them to read the file in a more intuitive fashion.
